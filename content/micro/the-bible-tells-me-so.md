*The Bible Tells Me So* by Peter Enns

Enns argues that most of the Old Testament is not actually trying to get the historical events right: it is a narrative designed to help exiled Israel and doesn't necessarily recount what happened or what God said or did.
I find his arguments convincing. But, he says the Bible is still valuable for meeting God through the stories of how others met God. I'm not sure how to do that through stories that don't always relay true things about God.
