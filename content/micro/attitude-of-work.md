In [*How We Think*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37423/37423-h/37423-h.htm), Dewey says that it's incorrect to think of the shift from an attitude of play to an attitude of work as a shift from interest in activiies for their own sake to an interest in results and products. Instead, it is only a change in the **types** of activities the child is interested in: she declines those that are moved forward by whim in favor of those that move toward a goal. It is still possible to enjoy even that kind of activity for its own sake.
