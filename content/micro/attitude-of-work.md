In *How We Think*, Dewey says that it's incorrect to think of the shift from an attitude of play to an attitude of work as a shift from interest in activities for their own sakes to an interest in results and products. They can both be interest in an activity for its own sake. It is a shift in the types of activities the child is interested in: from those that are moved forward by whim to those that move forward toward a goal.
