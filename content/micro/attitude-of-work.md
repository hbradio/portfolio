In [*How We Think*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37423/37423-h/37423-h.htm), Dewey says that a shift from an attitude-of-play to an attitude-of-work is not a shift in interest in activities for their own sake to an interest in results and products. Instead, it is only a change in the **type** of activity the child is interested in: she declines those that are moved forward by whim in favor of those that move toward a product.  She can be interested in an activity for its own sake *and* prefer that activity because it leads to a product.
