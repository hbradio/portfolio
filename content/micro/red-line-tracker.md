Ok, so it wasn't an original idea. So what? When me, my wife, and a few friends sat down at [Garfield Brewing](http://garfieldbrewery.com/) near a stop of Indianapolis' brand-new [Red Line rapid transit system](https://indyconnect.org/the-central-indiana-transit-plan/about-the-red-line/), we were beginning what we called the "Red Line Pub Crawl". And... so were the folks at the table next to us.

Inevitably, we had friends that couldn't come for the entire crawl but wanted to meet us later along the way. So they wouldn't have to call us, I made a little app so that we could post our location with a timestamp.

As you can see, we deviated from our plan almost immediately ðŸ˜€.

First take-away: using the browser API to get my current GPS location is not as scary as I thought! Now I know why every stinkin' site asks for it.

I didn't have time to learn how to use MapBox, so I made each entry link to a Google Map centered on the location. Feel free to [remix](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/red-line-pub-crawl) and extend it!
