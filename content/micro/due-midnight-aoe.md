```none
I wish I had a friend on Baker Island
So when it’s late at night here I could call them
Anywhere on Earth is just a timezone
We’re up here humming Eno, the rest is ocean

We’ve got walls caked with white noise
It disappears in its way
I guess it’s fair that I missed you
but I’m sure I don’t know all the right things to say

We started taking drives that you would sleep through
We learned it just made sense to: the house was danger.
In the waiting room they called you by your first name
(Don’t know nobody says James)
You call em neighbors

It makes no sense that I’d missed you
Gets better day after day 
And skin to skin breaks the pattern
And I promise that we’re gonna leave the house soon, okay?

I said there’re things I should teach you
Before the night passes by 
Like how you’d never think you really have to 
try so hard to tell the truth all the time
```
