*Love Wins* by Rob Bell.

Why did nobody tell me ten years ago that *Love Wins* is just a *Great Divorce* study guide?
American Evangelicals making any claim on C.S. Lewis is ridiculous, because The Gospel Coalition blog would immediately declare him a wolf.

The final chapter is a telling of the Gospel that is indistinguishable from (and accredited to) Tim Keller's. It wasn't weakened by following the "we all eventually turn away from Hell" chapter; on the contrary, I felt it more powerfully than I have anything in a long time.
