*After Evangelicalism* by David P. Gushee

Gushee says that he's found his "church" in a combination of a Jewish synagogue, Catholic Mass, and a really good home group. That's disappointing: I was hoping he'd make it easy and recommend some denomination.

My cynical theory is that TGC crushed Rob Bell so hard that progessive Christians don't start churches anymore; they just start podcasts.
