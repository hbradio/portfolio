Want to help your kids experience classical music, but don't know what to play? These are some of my favorites:

* What's good for bedtime/wind-down/cleanup
  * [Shostakovich's *Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major*, 2nd Movement](https://songwhip.com/dmitri-shostakovich/piano-concerto-no-2-in-f-major-op-102-ii-andante2015). (Pro-tip: The second movements are always the soft, pretty ones.)
* What's good for morning wakeup?
  * Shostakovich's [Prelude](https://songwhip.com/davidjalbert/24-preludes-and-fugues-op-87-prelude-no-7-in-a-major) and [Fugue](https://songwhip.com/davidjalbert/24-preludes-and-fugues-op-87-fugue-no-7-in-a-major) No. 7 from Opus 87
* But aren't they supposed to listen to Baroque/polyphonic music?
  * [Scarlatti's sonatas, played by Vladimir Horowitz](https://songwhip.com/vladimir-horowitz/horowitz-the-celebrated-scarlatti-recordings)
  * [Bach's *Goldberg Variations*, played by Glenn Gould](https://songwhip.com/johann-sebastian-bach/bach-the-goldberg-variations-bwv-988-1981-gould-remaster)
  * [Back's *Unaccompanied Cello Suites*, played by Yo-Yo Ma](https://songwhip.com/yo-yo-ma/bach-unaccompanied-cello-suites-remastered)
* What about modern/minimalist music?
  * [Brian Eno's *Ambient 1: Music for Airports*](https://songwhip.com/brian-eno/ambient-1-music-for-airports-remastered-2004)

This is heavy on piano music (what I know the most about). It's missing big symphonic moments, but I've found that those can be a little much to have on in the house.
