*Democracy and Education* by John Dewey. [ðŸŽ§](https://librivox.org/democracy-and-education-by-john-dewey/)

There's so much in this book, but I lived in "Chapter 23: Vocational Aspects of Education" for a while. (Emphasis below is mine.)

> There is a standing danger that education will perpetuate the older traditions for a select few, and effect its adjustment to the newer economic conditions more or less on the basis of acquiescence in the untransformed, unrationalized, and unsocialized phases of our defective industrial regime. Put in concrete terms, __there is danger that vocational education will be interpreted in theory and practice as trade education: as a means of securing technical efficiency in specialized future pursuits. Education would then become an instrument of perpetuating unchanged the existing industrial order of society, instead of operating as a means of its transformation.__ The desired transformation is not difficult to define in a formal way. It signifies a society in which every person shall be occupied in something which makes the lives of others better worth living, and which accordingly makes the ties which bind persons together more perceptibleâ€”which breaks down the barriers of distance between them. It denotes a state of affairs in which the interest of each in his work is uncoerced and intelligent: based upon its congeniality to his own aptitudes. It goes without saying that we are far from such a social state; in a literal and quantitative sense, we may never arrive at it. But in principle, the quality of social changes already accomplished lies in this direction. There are more ample resources for its achievement now than ever there have been before. No insuperable obstacles, given the intelligent will for its realization, stand in the way.

Dewey argues that all education should be vocational education ("The only adequate training for occupations is training through occupations" is perhaps the most frequent statement in the entire book) so long as we remember that:
* A vocation is simply what you do with your life to contribute to society.
* Art collecting is a vocation just as much as welding is. "To a considerable extent, the education of the dominant classes was essentially vocationalâ€”it only happened that their pursuits of ruling and of enjoying were not called professions... Unconsciously to themselves the higher institutions of learning have been made to contribute to preparation for these employments. Even at present, what is called higher education is for a certain class (much smaller than it once was) mainly preparation for engaging effectively in these pursuits."

Keeping these things in mind prevents vocational education from perpetuating separation between leisure and working classes.
