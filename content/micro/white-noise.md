*White Noise* by Don Delillo

Since this is the first post-modern fiction I've read, I can't tell if the theme of this book is that you can't know anything for sure, or if that's just all post-modern books. The public-health-communication context hit pretty hard, though.

Also, I think this Adam Driver movie is going to be great. It's basically a thriller.
