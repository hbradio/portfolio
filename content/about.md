    I'm a senior software engineer at Salesforce in Indianapolis.
  </p>
  <p>
    I co-founded an online coding platform for middle
    schoolers called <a href="https://rovercode.com">Rovercode</a>.
    <a href="https://medium.com/@bradyhurlburt/fd8862ad361c">I wrote here</a>
    about some things I think are important for designing online social learning
    for kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed Georgia Tech's
    <a href="https://twitter.com/GTOMSCS">OMSCS program</a> with a focus in
    Interactive Intelligence ðŸŽ“.
    <a href="/pdfs/peer-support-2018.pdf">
      Here's something I wrote</a
    >
    involving Papert, Scratch, and Glitch. I also have a BSEE and an MA in
    Teaching ðŸ“œ.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days I'm really enjoying some mathy postrock by <a href="https://concretemusic.bandcamp.com/">concrete, concrete</a> and some emo/pop-punk revival bands like Charmer and Hot Mulligan ðŸŽ¸.
