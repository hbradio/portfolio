    I'm a senior software developer at Salesforce. 
	I co-founded an online coding platform for middle
    schoolers called <a href="https://rovercode.com">Rovercode</a>.
    <a href="/micro/rovercode-ed-design-principles">I wrote here</a>
    about some things I think are important for designing online social learning
    for kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like school ðŸŽ“. I'm a graduate of Georgia Tech's
    <a href="https://twitter.com/GTOMSCS">OMSCS program</a> with a focus in
    interactive artificial intelligence, and I have a BS in electrical engineering and an MA in
    teaching ðŸ“œ.
    <a href="/pdfs/peer-support-2018.pdf">
      Here's something I wrote</a
    >
    about synchronous online peer support.
  </p>
  <p>
     Right now I'm looping <a href="https://songwhip.com/the-beths/futuremehatesme">The Beths</a>, and I'm hooked on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3jC5OdSSrrkbe_496i6gQ"> this YouTuber who covers songs in a pop-punk style</a> ðŸŽ¸.
